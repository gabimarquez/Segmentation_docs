Customer Journey Analytics
===========================

Customer journey analytics is applicable when you are working with data at and individual identity level over time.  The specific ID used can vary from individual level, household level, cookie level, etc but the common factor is this ID is persistent over time to allow gathering of a history of events/touchpoints for that ID over time.  Often the grain of these data is individual and timestamp level.  From an advanced measurement perspective this data is often leveraged to do attribution modeling, where the objective is to allocate the credit of a sale over multiple touchpoints that individual experienced over a period of time.  The advantage of this approach is highly granular and actionable insights.  The major challenge with this approach is the significant difficult in gathering accurate and complete data about the touchpoints that can be tied to that ID.  As privacy concerns increase and 3rd party cookies fade away this category of approaches will most commonly be deployed to known individuals and customers.â€‹
