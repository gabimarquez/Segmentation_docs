Traditional Marketing Mix models
==================================

Traditional marketing mix models leverage summarized data to determine the relationship between sales (or other KPI) and the factors that drive sales.  The summarized nature of marketing mix models has multiple advantages.  First these models can account for broad range of drivers of sales including media, promotions, price, competitive and economic factors.  Second these models inherently estimate the incremental impact these driver have on sales.  Finally, these models do not suffer from challenges with individual level data privacy concerns as they only leverage data aggregated at a geographic level.  The disadvantages of these models is that they tend to require a long time period of data (multiple years) and can’t provide very granular or tactical insights, making these models most appropriate for yearly or quarterly planning purposes.​
