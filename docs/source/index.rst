Measurement Library
==============================
This library is a work in progress which eventually will house **Blend360**'s data processes, analytical solutions, reusable codes, and even strategic insights with respect to different topics in marketing analytics. The content in this library can be used to (1) showcase **Blend360**'s capabilities, case studies, and innovative solutions to our existing or prospect clients, (2) train our DSX team and potentially client's team on specific topics in marketing analytics, and (3) provide an organization-wide reference of reusable codes and solutions accompanied by sufficient context, proper comments and actionable insights.

The Measurement Overview provides a one-stop guide for how brands look at each technique; each section then provides details on techniques including sample data and code.

Table of Content
=================
The structure below and in the sidebar is subject to change as the library grows and more content is added. For now, this structure is a proposal which presents a vision for populating the library. Please note that some of these pages do not have any content as of now and show place holder text.
