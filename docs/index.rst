Segmentation library
==============================
This library is a work in progress which eventually will house **Blend360**'s data processes, analytical solutions, reusable codes, in respect to segmantation.

The Measurement Overview provides a one-stop guide for how brands look at each technique; each section then provides details on techniques including sample data and code.

Table of Content
=================
The structure below and in the sidebar is subject to change as the library grows and more content is added. For now, this structure is a proposal which presents a vision for populating the library. Please note that some of these pages do not have any content as of now and show place holder text.
